# Health Hacks

### Task Reminders

No one wants to see your personal breakdown of goals or tasks on a shared system, and postits and written notes can be lost and fail ultimately at providing reminders that tasks need completed.

To manage task reminders, I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app) for everything; work, personal, shopping, etc. It works for reminding you about everything that needs done and helps you prioritise how much you can feasible complete in any given day.

### Reducing Eye Strain

During the day, computer screens look good—they're designed to look like the sun. But, at 9PM, 10PM, or 3AM, you probably shouldn't be looking at the sun. Install [Flux](https://justgetflux.com/) to help manage your screen brightness for you.
